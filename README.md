# hackingtool — Claude Code plugin

**183 pentesting & OSINT tools at Claude's fingertips.** Plugin-skill wrapper around [Z4nzu/hackingtool](https://github.com/Z4nzu/hackingtool). Runs locally on any OS — native Bash on Linux/macOS, WSL on Windows, or purpose-built Docker images (`instrumentisto/nmap`, `projectdiscovery/nuclei`, `caffix/amass`, and 20+ more). The skill picks the right backend and image automatically.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add AKCODEZ/hackingtool-plugin
/plugin install hackingtool@hackingtool-marketplace
```

Then point Claude at a target:

```
"recon example.com"
"hunt the username johndoe"
"scan my repo for vulnerabilies"
"crack my own wifi before my neighbor does"
```

Claude picks the tools. You read the output.

---

## How it works

Every tool invocation goes through `ht_run.py`, which:

1. Picks a backend chain: **native** (Linux/macOS), **WSL** (Windows + real distro), or **Docker** (anywhere Docker Desktop runs), and in auto mode can fall through to Docker when the local backend is missing the binary.
2. Maps known tools to **purpose-built Docker images** — fast pulls, clean ENTRYPOINTs, no `apt install` dance:

   | Category | Images |
   |---|---|
   | Port scanning | `instrumentisto/nmap`, `ilyaglow/masscan`, `rustscan/rustscan` |
   | Subdomain recon | `projectdiscovery/subfinder`, `caffix/amass`, `projectdiscovery/httpx` |
   | Vuln scanning | `projectdiscovery/nuclei`, `projectdiscovery/katana` |
   | OSINT | `megadose/holehe`, `soxoj/maigret`, `spiderfoot/spiderfoot`, `secsi/theharvester` |
   | Secrets | `trufflesecurity/trufflehog`, `zricethezav/gitleaks` |
   | Web attack | `secsi/ffuf`, `devopsworks/gobuster`, `drwetter/testssl.sh`, `0xsauby/wafw00f` |
   | SQL injection | `paoloo/sqlmap` |
   | Active Directory | `rflathers/impacket`, `byt3bl33d3r/netexec` |
   | Phishing recon | `elceef/dnstwist` |
   | Fallback | `kalilinux/kali-rolling` (for anything not in the override map) |

3. Runs the command, auto-retries with elevated privileges on permission errors (native/WSL), and surfaces the actual tool output as structured JSON.

The 🟢/🟡 icons in the inventory below are quick indicators of how the tool usually behaves — 🟢 for "plug-and-play" invocations, 🟡 for tools whose behavior depends on the backend and environment (adapter hardware, sudo config, etc.). Either way, the skill runs it and tells you what happened.

Current breakdown: **56 🟢 · 127 🟡 · 183 total**.

---

## OS support

The plugin picks a backend automatically via `ht_env.py`:

| Host | Backend |
|---|---|
| Linux / macOS native | `bash -lc <cmd>` |
| Windows + real WSL distro (Ubuntu, Kali, etc.) | `wsl -d <distro> -- bash -lc <cmd>` |
| Windows + Docker Desktop | `docker run --rm <image> <args>` |
| Linux / macOS with Docker available | native first, then Docker fallback when needed |

Docker images in the override map are pulled on first use and cached. `ht_run.py <tool_id> --install` runs the install commands for native/WSL when you need the binary on the host itself. On OpenClaw installs, the bundle is typically located at `~/.openclaw/extensions/hackingtool/`.

## Refreshing the tool index

When upstream hackingtool adds tools, regenerate `data/tools.json` and the README table:

```
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ht_index.py --hackingtool-path /path/to/hackingtool
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/build_readme_table.py > new_table.md
```

If hackingtool is a sibling directory of this repo, `--hackingtool-path` isn't needed — the script auto-detects.

## Limitations

- **Python 3.10+** required.
- **No async tool streaming.** Long-running tools block until they finish or timeout.
- **Docker backend** pulls `kalilinux/kali-rolling` on first use.
- **Capability flags are heuristics.** If you find a mis-tagged tool, fix it in `data/tools.json` or open an issue.
